# Full Stack E-Commerce Frontend

This is the frontend part of the full-stack e-commerce application, built using **React** and **Redux** for state management. The frontend communicates with the backend API to perform all necessary e-commerce actions such as displaying products, managing the cart, user authentication, and processing orders.

## Features

- **Product Display**: Display products, categories, and brands with filtering options.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add/remove products, view total prices, apply discount codes, and proceed to checkout.
- **User Authentication**: User registration, login, and JWT-based authentication for session management.
- **Order Management**: View previous orders, check order status, and manage user details.
- **Responsive UI**: Mobile-friendly design using CSS frameworks like React Bootstrap.
- **State Management with Redux**: Manage the global application state, including authentication status, cart, and products.

## Technologies

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management for handling the app's global state.
- **Formik**: Handling forms, especially for user authentication and checkout.
- **React Bootstrap**: UI components for building responsive layouts.
